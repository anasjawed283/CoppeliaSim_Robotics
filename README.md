# CoppeliaSim_Robotics

Welcome to **CoppeliaSim_Robotics**! This repository contains a collection of simulation files created using [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/), an advanced robotics simulation software. The simulations range from basic to advanced levels, covering various robotics systems and concepts.

## About the Project

The **CoppeliaSim_Robotics** repository is designed to assist developers, students, and researchers in exploring and implementing robotics concepts through simulations. It includes a variety of examples and scenarios that demonstrate real-world robotics applications.

### Key Features:
- **Basic Robotics Simulations**: Starting with simple robotic mechanisms and movements.
- **Advanced Robotics Simulations**: Includes complex systems like multi-robot coordination, path planning, and manipulations.
- **Scalable Projects**: Each project can be modified and expanded for custom use.
- **Educational Use**: Ideal for learning and teaching robotics concepts in a virtual environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Download and install **CoppeliaSim** from the official [website](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anasjawed283/CoppeliaSim_Robotics.git
   ```

### Running the Simulations
1. Open **CoppeliaSim** on your local machine.
2. Load any `.ttt` simulation file from the repository.
3. Press the "Play" button in CoppeliaSim to start the simulation.

## Repository Structure

- **/Basic_Simulations/**: Contains entry-level projects focusing on basic robotic mechanisms.
